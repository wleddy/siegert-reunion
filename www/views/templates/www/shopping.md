## Malls

### The Woodlands Mall

Their website says there are nearly 200 stores and restaurants here. If it's not here
you either don't need it or can't pay for it.

### The Willowbrook Mall 

Judging from the fact that the web site id essentially identical to The Woodlands Mall, 
I think you can assume that the malls are also the same.

### The Houston Galleria 

Where as the other malls listed here only have 200 stores each and the Galleria claims to have
400, there is more of the exact same stuff or way more stuff than anybody needs (or both) here.
