## Snack 'n things

We will be catering some meals as well as snacks and drinks at the clubhouse
but we plan on venturing out into wilds of Houston a couple of dinners and the
final breakfast. All meals will be "Dutch".

We are asking that everyone contribute $25 per person to help with the cost of
catering and rental of the hall. - _Thanks_
